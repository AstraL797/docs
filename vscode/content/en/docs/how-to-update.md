  ðŸš€ How to update to the new Official Puppet VS Code Extension
---

The Puppet extension is ðŸšš moving! We are changing from `jpogran.puppet-vscode` to `puppet.puppet-vscode` in the VS Code Marketplace! Check out the [puppet blog post](https://puppet.com/blog/whats-new-with-the-puppet-vscode-extension) for more information on why.

The new extension can be found at [Puppet VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=puppet.puppet-vscode). Note that the `jpogran.puppet-vscode` extension will no longer receive updates.

## How to Update to the new Extension

In order to use the new extension, you can install it using the [normal installation methods](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) or you can can also update it from the commandline by running the following commands:

To uninstall the `jpogran.puppet-vscode` extension:

```bash
> code --uninstall-extension jpogran.puppet-vscode
```

To install the `puppet.puppet-vscode` extension:

```bash
> code --install-extension puppet.puppet-vscode
```
